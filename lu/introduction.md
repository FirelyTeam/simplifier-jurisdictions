**In Luxembourg**, the regulatory environment for health data exchange does not specifically mention FHIR; however, Article 60ter of the National Health Fund Code provides a general framework for health data interoperability. There is no compliance deadline or fines for non-adherence detailed, which suggests a flexible approach towards adoption. The Agence eSanté defines the eHealth Interoperability Framework within the National Interoperability Framework aligned with the European Interoperability Framework (EIF).

## National Standards Development

Agence eSanté, the national agency responsible for eHealth, is leading the charge in setting interoperability standards. While there is no national FHIR data model currently, Luxembourg has taken steps to implement FHIR in several specific areas. The development and adoption of FHIR standards appear to be in their initial stages, with the agency supporting and guiding this process.

## FHIR Implementation

The adoption of FHIR in Luxembourg is still in its early stages, with a few projects underway. EHR vendors and app developers are encouraged to adopt FHIR standards for new health interoperability projects. Notable initiatives include ePrescription (Lab + Pharma) and eDispensation, as well as Lab Result standards. These cases indicate an inclination towards using FHIR for structure and APIs where applicable.

Despite the progress, challenges like high investment costs and a lack of FHIR knowledge are recognized. The focus remains on improving care and fostering innovation in health data management through the adoption of FHIR where it's feasible and beneficial.

The Agence eSanté Luxembourg is a key stakeholder in the transition towards more widespread use of FHIR standards, working to overcome barriers and enhance the country's health IT infrastructure.
