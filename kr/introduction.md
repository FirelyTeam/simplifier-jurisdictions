**In the Republic of Korea**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is beginning to play a significant role in healthcare data exchange. Currently, FHIR version R4 is actively being used, indicating the country is adopting modern standards for healthcare interoperability. There is an expectation of increased adoption of FHIR in the coming years, suggesting ongoing progress and integration into the healthcare system.

## Rules and Support for Health Data Exchange

- **Health Data Exchange Rules**: Regulations mandate the use of standards in electronic health data exchange.
- **FHIR Requirements**: The regulation specifically advises the use of FHIR.
- **Deadlines**: There is no specific deadline for compliance included in the regulation.
- **Available Funding**: Government funds are available to stimulate the adoption of FHIR.

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization**: There is a national organization responsible for health data standards.

- **Implementation Guides**: A base/core FHIR implementation guide is widely used.
  - [National FHIR Implementation Guide](https://hins.or.kr/nrc_fhir/site/index.html)
- **Terminology Services**: A national FHIR terminology server is in development.

## Active Use Cases

There are no specific use cases mentioned, but the wide use of the core FHIR implementation guide suggests its application across various healthcare data exchange areas.

## Who's Using FHIR

- **Active Organizations**:
  - Care providers
  - EHR system vendors
  - Diagnostic system vendors, like Imaging/Lab
  - App developers
- **Main Reasons for Adoption**: The adoption is driven by regulation and grants, highlighting the importance of standardized health data exchange for improving healthcare outcomes.

## Success Stories and Challenges

While specific success stories and challenges were not detailed, the neutral satisfaction with the FHIR adoption rate and the development of a national FHIR data model suggest a balanced view of progress and obstacles in FHIR implementation.

## Future Plans

- **Progress So Far**: There has been quite the progress expected in last year's FHIR adoption.
- **Next Steps**: Continued development of a national FHIR data model and new regulation that prescribes the use of standards in electronic health data exchange are highlights.
- **Expected Changes**: Within the next three years, significant cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a more robust digital health ecosystem are anticipated benefits from FHIR adoption.
