**In Norway**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is becoming a key standard for healthcare data exchange. Its usage varies across different versions, with R4 being the most actively used. There's a growing expectation that FHIR adoption will increase in the coming years, driven by its potential for improving healthcare data interoperability.

## Rules and Support
- **Health Data Exchange Rules:**
  - Some regulations mandate the use of national standards in health data exchange.
  - FHIR is advised in certain contexts but not specifically mentioned in regulations.
- **FHIR Requirements and Deadlines:**
  - No specific deadlines or fines for non-compliance mentioned.
- **Available Funding:**
  - Government funds are available for supporting FHIR adoption, particularly in the municipal sector. About EUR 90,000 is expected to support FHIR through HL7 Norway. [More about funding](https://www.helsedirektoratet.no/digitalisering-og-e-helse/helseteknologiordningen)

## National Setup
- **Standards Organization:**
  - The Directorate of Health oversees health data standards. [Helsedirektoratet](https://www.helsedirektoratet.no/)
- **Implementation Guides:**
  - A widely used base/core FHIR implementation guide exists. [HL7 Norway Basis](https://simplifier.net/hl7norwayno-basis)
- **Terminology Services:**
  - Currently, there is no national FHIR terminology server, but plans are in place to develop one.

## Active Use Cases
- Successful local implementations include the HelseNorge-app and services for digital home monitoring.
- Norway participates in international projects, such as the European SPOR IG, indicating a growing alignment with international standards.
- Key projects include NOMA's FHIR Distribution Services from the SAFEST project.

## Who's Using FHIR
- **Active Organizations:**
  - Healthcare providers, EHR system vendors, and app developers are actively using FHIR.
- **Main Reasons for Adoption:**
  - Improving health outcomes, enhancing care workflows, and fostering innovation are the primary motivators.
- **How They're Using FHIR:**
  - FHIR is utilized in messaging, documentation, REST APIs, and for SMART on FHIR applications among others.

## Success Stories and Challenges
- **Benefits:**
  - FHIR has led to improved access to information and has the potential to lower costs.
- **Real Examples:**
  - The HelseNorge app and central medication service are noted success stories.
- **Main Difficulties:**
  - Challenges include high investment costs, unclear regulations, and a lack of FHIR knowledge.
- **Future Plans:**
  - Plans for a central national medication registry and further development of FHIR standards are underway.

## Future Plans
- **Progress So Far:**
  - While progress varies, there has been a significant adoption in some areas, and the healthcare ecosystem is gradually expanding its use of FHIR.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Development of new FHIR standards for specific use cases and the launch of pilot projects with healthcare stakeholders are planned.
- **Expected Changes:**
  - Significant benefits from FHIR adoption are anticipated in the next three years, including cost savings and enhanced care coordination.
