**In Ireland**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is currently being utilized to some extent for exchanging healthcare data, indicating a foundational use within the healthcare IT infrastructure. Among the FHIR versions, R4 is notably in use, marked with a usage score of 4. There is an anticipation of a significant increase in FHIR adoption in the coming years, suggesting a strategic move towards enhancing healthcare data interoperability.

## Rules and Support
- **Health Data Exchange Rules and Regulations:**
  - Ireland has regulations in place mandating the use of standards for electronic health data exchange.
  - Specific mention of FHIR in these regulations is unclear.
  - Compliance deadlines are included, but without fines for non-compliance.
- **Available Funding:**
  - It's not clear if government funds are available to support FHIR adoption.
- **Relevant Legislation:**
  - EHDS Regulations & Health Information Bill: [View Details](https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space-regulation-ehds_en)
  - Health Information Bill: [View Details](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2024/61/)

## National Setup
- **Standards Organization:**
