**In Slovakia**, the use of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for exchanging healthcare data is in its early stages, with limited current usage. There's no specific information on active FHIR versions in use, such as DSTU2, STU3, R4, etc., as the survey responses are marked with a question mark for these fields. However, there's an expectation for a significant increase in the adoption of FHIR in the coming years, despite the present challenges and the nascent stage of implementation.

## Rules and Support for Health Data Exchange
- **Regulations**: Slovakia has regulations mandating the use of standards in electronic health data exchange.
  - **FHIR Mention**: The regulation does not specifically mention FHIR.
  - **Deadlines and Fines**: There are no deadlines for compliance nor fines for non-compliance mentioned.
- **Funding**: There are no government funds available specifically to stimulate the adoption of FHIR.
- **Relevant Regulations**: 
  - Decree No. 107/2015 Coll. and No. 34/2022 Coll. of the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic establish standards of health informatics and deadlines for the provision of data. More details can be found in Slovak legislation documents.

## National Setup
- **Standards Organization**: The National Centre of Health Information (NCZI) is responsible for health data standards in Slovakia. Visit [NCZI](https://www.nczisk.sk/en/Pages/default.aspx) for more information.
- **Implementation Guides**: Currently, Slovakia does not have officially published national FHIR specifications or implementation guides.
- **Terminology Services**: A national FHIR terminology server is in planning but not yet available.

## Active Use Cases
- **Local Implementations**: Specific local implementations of FHIR were not detailed, indicating a broader need for development in this area.
- **International Standards Use**: Slovakia has not yet adopted international FHIR specifications as a formal basis.
- **Key Projects**: The upcoming update of the National Health Information System (NHIS) is expected to include new digital health services requiring FHIR implementation.

## Who's Using FHIR
- **Organizations**: The survey does not list specific organizations actively using FHIR, but mentions roles such as diagnostic system vendors and app developers as engaged with FHIR.
- **Reasons for Adoption**: The expectation of improved healthcare outcomes, improved access to information, and improved care workflows are main motivators.
- **Usage**: FHIR is seen as a potential framework for innovation in healthcare data exchange and interoperability.

## Success Stories and Challenges
- **Benefits**: Early adopters have noted improved healthcare outcomes, access to information, and care workflows as significant benefits of FHIR.
- **Real Examples**: Exact examples were not provided, reflecting the early stage of FHIR adoption in Slovakia.
- **Difficulties**: A lack of FHIR knowledge and changes in political direction are cited as main challenges.
- **Future Plans**: The country looks forward to the NHIS update and compliance with the European Health Data Space (EHDS) Regulation as key FHIR implementation projects.

## Future Plans
- **Progress**: There is an acknowledgment of the progress made in FHIR adoption, although satisfaction levels vary.
- **Next Steps**: Expansion of FHIR across the healthcare ecosystem, including launching pilot projects with healthcare stakeholders.
- **Expected Changes**: Significant cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a more robust digital health ecosystem are anticipated benefits in the next three years.
