*The following is based on the answers to the [State of FHIR survey 2023](https://fire.ly/blog/fhir-maturity-and-adoption-around-the-world/) from Jens Kristian Villadsen, Trifork.*

## Regulation

Denmark is progressing towards integrating FHIR in healthcare data exchange, although specific regulations that prescribe the use of FHIR standards are not clearly indicated. There is an absence of information about deadlines for compliance and whether there are any fines for not adhering to such regulations. Currently, there are no known funds or programs explicitly designed to stimulate the adoption of FHIR in Denmark.

## National Standards Development

Sundhedsdatastyrelsen, the Danish Health Data Authority, is at the forefront of national standards development, including FHIR. The national FHIR data model is operational but is being used in a limited set of use cases. Documentation related to this can be found on the [Danish eHealth portal](https://docs.ehealth.sundhed.dk/). A few FHIR standards for more specific use cases have been developed, and some of these are derived from the national FHIR data model.

## FHIR Implementation

FHIR adoption is expected to continue growing moderately. Its current use is relatively established and is seen in a few successful implementations that have improved access to information. The Future of Health Technology (FUT) is one such example, although detailed information about it was not provided. 

Challenges such as high investment costs, perceived unclear benefits, and a lack of knowledge about FHIR are recognized barriers to its widespread implementation. Despite these challenges, Denmark is noted for its innovative approach to EHR systems and healthcare data management.

*While there is patient advocacy for the availability of healthcare data, led by groups like Danske Patienter, these efforts do not specifically focus on health data standards such as FHIR. Nonetheless, improved access to information remains a key outcome of the existing FHIR implementations.*
