**In Denmark**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is becoming a cornerstone for exchanging healthcare data. Currently, Denmark utilizes various versions of FHIR, with R4 being the most prominent. The country is witnessing a gradual but steady adoption of FHIR standards, with an expectation of increased use in the coming years. This growth is anticipated despite the absence of specific mentions of FHIR in current regulations.

## Rules and Support

- Health data exchange in Denmark is regulated, with mandates for using standardized formats.
- While regulations do not specify FHIR, its adoption is influenced by general standards requirements.
- Deadlines for compliance and details on penalties are not widely known.
- No government funds are directly allocated for FHIR adoption. However, information about regulations can be found [here](https://sundhedsdatastyrelsen.dk/digitale-loesninger/referencearkitektur-og-standarder/udvalg).

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization:** Denmark has dedicated organizations like MedCom and RUSA for health data standards. More details can be found [here](https://sundhedsdatastyrelsen.dk/digitale-loesninger/referencearkitektur-og-standarder/udvalg).
- **Implementation Guides:** A base/core FHIR implementation guide specific to Denmark is available, highlighting limited use cases. Access the guide [here](https://hl7.dk/).
- **Terminology Services:** A national FHIR terminology server is in planning but not yet in production.

## Active Use Cases

- Denmark has seen the development of FHIR standards for specific use cases, including public health reporting and document exchange.
- The country has been active in both local implementations and adapting international standards.
- Key projects include FUT (an e-health platform) and efforts towards SMART/IPA and IHE MHD interfacing.

## Who's Using FHIR

- Organizations involved range from care providers to EHR (Electronic Health Record) system vendors.
- The main reasons for FHIR adoption include regulation compliance, modernization of data exchange, and innovation.
- FHIR is being used for messaging, document exchange, and REST APIs, among others.

## Success Stories and Challenges

- Successful use cases have led to improved access to information and care workflows. Examples include [FUT](https://ehealth.sundhed.dk/fhir/) and the DK MedCom Hospital Notification.
- Main difficulties include high investment costs, unclear benefits, and a lack of FHIR-specific knowledge.
- Future plans are focusing on expanding FUT, more SMART/IPA implementations, and further interfacing with IHE MHD.

## Future Plans

- Denmark expects to continue making progress in FHIR adoption, with plans for new standards development and pilot projects.
- The country is working towards expanded adoption across the healthcare ecosystem, in partnership with national agencies.
- Significant cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a robust digital health ecosystem are anticipated benefits in the coming years.
