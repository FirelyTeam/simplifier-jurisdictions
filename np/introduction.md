**In Nepal**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is beginning to be utilized for healthcare data exchange, albeit on a limited scale. Currently, version R4 of FHIR is in use, indicating a nascent but growing adoption of this standard. Expectations for the coming years include a significant increase in the rate of FHIR adoption. This optimism is partly due to the completion of EMR/SHR Guidelines and the drafting of a National Digital Health Blueprint that emphasizes the importance of FHIR and health data standards.

## Rules and Support for FHIR Adoption

- **Health Data Exchange Rules:**
  - There are regulations mandating the use of standards in electronic health data exchange, though FHIR is not specifically mentioned.
  - No deadlines or fines are imposed for non-compliance, but the absence of government funds for FHIR adoption is noted.

- **FHIR Requirements and Funding:**
  - Despite the regulatory environment not being fully supportive of FHIR, initiatives like OpenIMIS are being utilized for insurance program claim processing.

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization:**
  - Currently, Nepal does not have a national organization responsible for health data standards. However, there are efforts towards establishing such an entity.

- **Implementation Guides:**
  - A base/core FHIR implementation guide exists and is used in limited use cases. It can be found [here](https://openimis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/40501266/Nepal+-+Health+Insurance+Board).

- **Terminology Services:**
  - A national FHIR terminology server is in planning stages, indicating future development in this area.

## Active Use Cases

- Local implementations include the use of FHIR in the National Health Insurance Board's claim processing and in supporting the scale of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) with digital health tools.
- The country is committed to leveraging FHIR for AMR from 26 different sites and exploring its utilization for migrant workers and regional standards to support healthcare ecosystems.

## Who's Using FHIR

Organizations actively using FHIR in Nepal range from care providers to EHR system vendors and app developers. The main motivations for adopting FHIR include:
- Improving health outcomes
- Enhancing care workflows
- Driving innovation

These goals are being pursued through FHIR's capabilities for messaging, document handling, and REST APIs.

## Success Stories and Challenges

- **Benefits:**
  - Improved healthcare outcomes and workflows have been highlighted as clear benefits of FHIR adoption.
  - Specific projects like OpenIMIS showcase the practical application and advantages of FHIR in insurance claim processing.

- **Challenges:**
  - High investment costs, unclear benefits and regulations, and a lack of FHIR knowledge are main difficulties.
  - Political changes also pose a risk to the continuity and success of FHIR implementations.

- **Future Plans:**
  - Plans include the implementation of a National Health Data Exchange and the development of new FHIR standards for specific use cases.

## Future Plans

- **Progress So Far:**
  - Nepal has made far more progress than expected in the last year regarding FHIR adoption, with stakeholders expressing high satisfaction.

- **Next Steps:**
  - The focus is on expanding the adoption of FHIR across the healthcare ecosystem and launching pilot projects with healthcare stakeholders.

- **Expected Changes:**
  - Significant cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a more robust digital health ecosystem are anticipated benefits in the next three years.
