**In Thailand**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is starting to make its mark on healthcare data exchange. The current use varies across different versions, with a notable emphasis on the R4 version, indicating a moderate level of adoption. Respondents anticipate a steady, though not rapid, increase in FHIR adoption in the coming years, reflecting a cautious optimism about the technology's potential to improve healthcare data interoperability in Thailand.

## Rules and Support

- **Health Data Exchange Rules:**
  - No specific regulation mandates the use of standards in electronic health data exchange, including FHIR.
- **FHIR Requirements:**
  - While not specifically mentioned in regulations, FHIR is beginning to be recognized for its utility in healthcare data exchange.
- **Deadlines and Compliance:**
  - There are currently no deadlines or fines imposed for non-compliance with FHIR standards.
- **Available Funding:**
  - Government funds are available to stimulate the adoption of FHIR, encouraging its use across healthcare systems.

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization:**
  - The Ministry of Public Health is a key organization responsible for health data standards in Thailand. Another notable organization is the [Thai Health Information Standards Development Center](https://www.this.or.th/).
- **Implementation Guides:**
  - Thailand has a base/core FHIR implementation guide used in a limited set of use cases, available [here](https://fhir-ig.sil-th.org/th/mophpc1/index.html).
- **Terminology Services:**
  - Currently, there is no national FHIR terminology server, and there are no plans to develop one.

## Active Use Cases

- Local implementations focus on areas such as:
  - Prescriptions / Pharmacy
  - Referrals / Continuity of care
  - Terminology
  - Diagnostic Orders/Reports
  - International Patient Summary
- Key projects are underway, though specific examples were not mentioned.

## Who's Using FHIR

- Active organizations include government sectors, indicating a top-down approach to adopting FHIR standards.
- The main reasons for adoption appear to be the potential for improved interoperability and data exchange efficiency.
- FHIR is primarily being used to enhance healthcare data exchange and integration.

## Success Stories and Challenges

- **Benefits:**
  - The adoption of FHIR is expected to lead to improved healthcare outcomes and access to information, though specific success stories were not detailed.
- **Challenges:**
  - High investment costs and unclear regulations are significant barriers.
  - A lack of specific FHIR knowledge and unclear benefits contribute to hesitation among potential adopters.
- **Future Plans:**
  - There's an interest in developing new FHIR standards for more specific use cases and launching pilot projects with healthcare stakeholders.

## Future Plans

- Progress so far includes the establishment of a core FHIR implementation guide and anticipation of expanded adoption across the healthcare ecosystem.
- Next steps are focused on developing new FHIR standards and launching pilot projects.
- Expected changes include a continued gradual increase in FHIR adoption, despite current challenges and dissatisfaction with the pace of progress.
