**In Chile**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is becoming an increasingly important standard for the exchange of healthcare data. Currently, the version R4 is most widely used, with promising adoption levels and significant plans for future implementation. The country expects to see a rise in the use of FHIR in the coming years, driven by regulatory support and the active development of implementation guides.

## Rules and Support
- **Health Data Exchange Rules and FHIR Requirements:**
  - Chile has regulations mandating the use of standards in electronic health data exchange.
  - FHIR is specifically mandated in these regulations.
  - There is no deadline for compliance mentioned, nor are there fines for non-compliance.
- **Available Funding:**
  - Government funds are available to stimulate the adoption of FHIR.
- **Relevant Regulations and Funds Links:**
  - Law 21541 of Telemedicine and its technical normative No. 237; Law 21688 of Interoperable Health Registry. [Ley 21668](https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=1203827), [Norma general técnica 237](https://portalsaluddigital.minsal.cl/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025.01.06_NORMA-TECNICA-PRESTACIONES-DE-SALUD-A-DISTANCIA-Y-TELEMEDICINA.pdf)

## National Setup
- **Standards Organization:**
  - DEIS and HL7 Chile are responsible for health data standards in Chile. [DEIS](https://deis.minsal.cl/), [HL7 Chile](https://hl7chile.cl/)
- **Implementation Guides:**
  - A widely used base/core FHIR implementation guide is available. [Chilean Core Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7Chile/clcore_ig/)
- **Terminology Services:**
  - A national FHIR terminology server is currently in development.

## Active Use Cases
- **Local Implementations and International Standards Use:**
  - Use cases include specialty care waiting times and national electronic prescriptions.
  - International Patient Summary and other specific use cases like referrals/continuity of care, public health reporting, and immunizations.
- **Key Projects:**
  - Projects focusing on patient history summaries, primary care agenda, and immunizations.

## Who's Using FHIR
- **Active Organizations:**
  - Government, EHR system vendors, and care providers are actively using FHIR.
- **Main Reasons for Adoption:**
  - Improving healthcare outcomes, access to information, and care workflows.
- **How They're Using FHIR:**
  - Through FHIR Messaging, REST API, and SMART on FHIR among others.

## Success Stories and Challenges
- **Clear Benefits:**
  - Improved healthcare outcomes and access to information have been noted as significant benefits.
- **Real Examples:**
  - Specialty care waiting times and national electronic prescriptions projects are highlighted successes.
- **Main Difficulties:**
  - Challenges include unclear benefits, lack of FHIR knowledge, and changes in political direction.
- **Future Plans:**
  - Looking forward to implementing patient summaries, surgical waiting times, and prescriptions among other use cases.

## Future Plans
- **Progress So Far:**
  - Chile has made more progress than expected in the last year regarding FHIR adoption.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Development of a national FHIR data model and new regulations to prescribe the use of standards.
