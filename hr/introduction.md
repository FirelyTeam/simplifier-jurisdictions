*This overview is based on the insights gathered from the DevDays 2024 State of FHIR survey.*

### Regulation

Croatia's health data exchange is guided by the [Law on Data and Information in Healthcare](https://www.zakon.hr/z/1883/Zakon-o-podacima-i-informacijama-u-zdravstvu), which prescribes standards but does not explicitly mention FHIR. Compliance deadlines and fines are not part of this regulation. The Central Healthcare Information System of the Republic of Croatia (CEZIH) is heavily based on HL7 standards, with some functionalities adopting FHIR. CEZIH serves as a comprehensive platform for healthcare information exchange, encompassing electronic health records, patient portals, and national applications.

### Adoption

FHIR is in its nascent stages in Croatia, with initial use in select cases. The R4 version is the most recognized among current adopters, anticipating a significant rise in FHIR adoption in the future. The main drivers include regulation, improved care, and innovative solutions fostering greater interoperability via HL7 FHIR.

### Authoritative Bodies

The Ministry of Health plays a pivotal role in the implementation and regulatory framework of health data standards in Croatia. Additionally, the [Croatian Institute of Public Health](https://www.hzjz.hr/en/) and [HL7 Croatia](https://www.hl7.hr/) are significant stakeholders, providing oversight and guidance in this domain.

### Relevant Institutes

Organizations spearheading FHIR adoption include Ericsson Nikola Tesla d.d. and IN2, alongside key healthcare providers, payers, insurers, EHR vendors, and app developers. This collaborative ecosystem is integral to the advancement and implementation of FHIR standards within Croatia.

### National Standards Development

Croatia lacks a specific national organization dedicated to developing health data exchange standards. However, the CEZIH project serves as the de facto framework, evolving national eHealth standards primarily based on HL7 v2 and advancing towards FHIR for more nuanced, specific use cases.

### Terminology Usage

The transition to FHIR is expected to enhance terminology standardization, facilitating better interoperability and data sharing across different healthcare systems.

### Infrastructure

Croatia's healthcare infrastructure is well-grounded in the CEZIH system, which mandates that all medical information exchanges pass through its centralized platform. This mandate ensures that all integrated applications and information systems adhere to the relevant standards and interfaces.


In conclusion, while FHIR's adoption in Croatia is still in its early stages, the regulatory framework and infrastructure reflect a strong foundation for future growth. The collaborative efforts among regulatory bodies, healthcare providers, and technology organizations signal a promising trajectory for FHIR's enhanced role in Croatia's healthcare landscape.
