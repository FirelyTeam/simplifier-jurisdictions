*The following is based on the answers to the [State of FHIR survey 2023](https://fire.ly/blog/fhir-maturity-and-adoption-around-the-world/) from Alexander Henket, Nictiz.*

The Netherlands exhibits a proactive and forward-looking stance on the adoption and implementation of FHIR standards for healthcare data interoperability.

## Regulation

The Netherlands is setting a commendable example in healthcare data exchange regulation with the Wegiz law and the upcoming European Health Data Space (EHDS), which specifically mandate the use of FHIR. The country is working towards a consistent health information framework that includes FHIR STU3 and R4 as part of its baseline. The deadline for compliance with these regulations is set for the end of 2026, highlighting the urgency and importance placed on standardization. Further details can be found on the [official website for healthcare data exchange](https://www.gegevensuitwisselingindezorg.nl/gegevensuitwisseling).

## National Standards Development

Nictiz, the national standards organization, is at the forefront of the FHIR data model development in the Netherlands. The widely used national FHIR data models are published and accessible on Simplifier for [STU3](https://simplifier.net/nictizstu3-zib2017) and [R4](https://simplifier.net/nictiz-r4-zib2020). There's a concerted effort to ensure that these models and other specific use case standards are internationally and generically compatible, which reflects an intelligent and strategic approach to healthcare interoperability.

## FHIR Implementation

There is an evident commitment to innovation within the FHIR community in the Netherlands. Successful use cases like MedMij for patient-centric infrastructure, Koppeltaal for mental health gaming, and ZorgAB for provider directory services showcase improved healthcare outcomes and information access. As the Netherlands gears up for R4 with some implementations going live this year, the focus is on backward compatibility and international compatibility, underscoring the country's dedication to practical and sustainable healthcare solutions.

Patient advocacy, particularly by the Dutch Patient Federation (PatiÃ«ntenfederatie Nederland), underscores the nation's commitment to improved healthcare data availability, even if not specifically focused on FHIR. The Netherlands is also looking forward to integrating the European Health Data Space (EHDS) and the International Patient Summary (IPS) into its national setup, reinforcing its role as a leader in healthcare data interoperability.
