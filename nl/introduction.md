*This overview is based on the insights gathered from the DevDays 2024 State of FHIR survey, with a comparison to the 2023 survey to highlight the progress and changes.*

### Regulation

The Netherlands has established robust regulations to mandate the use of standards in electronic health data exchange. Key regulations include **Wegiz (NL)** and **EHDS (EU)**, both of which explicitly mandate the use of FHIR. Compliance with these regulations is expected by January 1, 2026, an earlier deadline compared to the previous year. To support this transition, the Ministry of Health is providing funds to stimulate FHIR adoption, reinforcing the commitment to a standardized healthcare data exchange system. The integration of Health Clinical Information Models (HCIMs) further underpins the use of FHIR, ensuring a structured approach to health data standards.

### Adoption

FHIR is already being utilized in several use cases across the Netherlands, with significant adoption of **STU3** and **R4** versions. The adoption rate has seen an increase from 2023, moving from a rating of 2 to 3, indicating broader use cases though not yet the main standard. The adoption rate is expected to see a strong increase in the coming years, driven by regulatory mandates and the availability of grants. The primary adopters of FHIR include care providers, payers, insurers, EHR vendors, and app developers, all of whom are motivated by the promise of improved care, innovation, and regulatory compliance.

### Authoritative Bodies

The adoption and implementation of FHIR in the Netherlands are guided by authoritative bodies such as **HL7-NL** and **Nictiz**. These organizations play a pivotal role in the development and dissemination of national standards and ensure alignment with international best practices.

### Relevant Institutes

Institutes like **MedMij** are at the forefront of patient advocacy, specifically focusing on the availability and standardization of healthcare data, including FHIR. This represents a shift from 2023, where the Dutch Patient Federation was noted but did not specifically focus on FHIR. MedMij's successful use cases have demonstrated significant achievements such as lowered costs, improved healthcare outcomes, and enhanced access to information.

### National Standards Development

The Netherlands boasts a national FHIR data model, accessible via [Nictiz FHIR NL Core](https://simplifier.net/packages/nictiz.fhir.nl.r4.nl-core). This model is currently being used in a  set of use cases. The national standards organization, **Nictiz**, spearheads the development of these models, ensuring they meet the specific needs of the Dutch healthcare system.

### Infrastructure

The Netherlands has developed a comprehensive regional and national infrastructure to support FHIR implementation. Software companies are required to integrate with this infrastructure to ensure seamless data exchange. This well-established infrastructure is a critical enabler for the widespread adoption of FHIR, providing the necessary technical backbone for efficient and secure health data exchange.

### FHIR Implementation

The main parties adopting FHIR in the Netherlands include care providers, payers/insurers, EHR vendors, and app developers. Researchers, who were mentioned in 2023, are not specifically noted in the 2024 survey. The main drivers for FHIR adoption remain consistent with regulation and grants, improved care, and innovation being the key factors.

The challenges for FHIR adoption remain largely the same, including high investment costs, unclear benefits, unclear regulations, and lack of FHIR knowledge.

The integration of **IPS** into the national setup continues to be a significant future use case, consistent with the 2023 survey.

In conclusion, the Netherlands is making significant strides in the adoption of FHIR, driven by strong regulatory support, active involvement of key stakeholders, and a well-defined national infrastructure. The future of FHIR in the Netherlands looks promising, with expectations of increased adoption and continued improvements in healthcare outcomes.
