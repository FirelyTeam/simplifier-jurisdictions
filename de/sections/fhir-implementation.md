## FHIR Implementation

FHIR implementation in Germany is looking forward to advancements in patient safety for prescriptions and patient summaries. There is anticipation for ISiK Levels 2 and 3, and oncology-related implementations. Key stakeholders are optimistic despite recognizing high investment costs and a lack of FHIR knowledge as significant challenges. Successful use cases of FHIR include the German ePrescription system and various initiatives led by the Medical Informatics Initiative.

The adoption of FHIR is expected to continue rising, with several specific FHIR standards developed for use cases like ePrescriptions and medical information objects. These developments align with the interests of care providers, insurers, EHR vendors, and app developers who are actively engaged in the FHIR ecosystem. Patient advocacy groups also pay attention to health data standards, with some specifically advocating for FHIR.
