**In the United Arab Emirates (UAE)**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is becoming an increasingly important standard for exchanging healthcare data. Current use is rated at a level 4 out of 5, indicating significant adoption across the country. Versions DSTU2, STU3, R4, R4B, and R5 are all in use, with each version rated equally for usage intensity. Looking forward, there's an expectation of increased adoption, predicting a positive change in how healthcare information is shared.
