The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard is increasingly being utilized in **the United States** to facilitate the exchange of healthcare data. Currently, version R4 of FHIR is the most actively used, with a noticeable implementation score of 5. However, earlier versions like DSTU2 and STU3 are still in question, while R5 is beginning to see some use. The adoption of FHIR is expected to grow in the coming years, as indicated by a positive outlook from industry respondents.

## Rules and Support for FHIR

The United States has regulations in place that mandate the use of standards in electronic health data exchange, specifically mentioning FHIR:

- **Health Data Exchange Rules**: Yes, there are specific regulations mandating the use of FHIR.
- **FHIR Requirements**: FHIR is mandated within these regulations.
- **Compliance Deadline**: Yes, there's a set deadline for compliance.
- **Fines**: No fines are imposed for non-compliance before the deadline.
- **Government Funding**: No, there are no government funds available to stimulate FHIR adoption.

## National Setup for FHIR

In the United States, the development and adoption of FHIR standards are supported by multiple national organizations:

- **Standards Organizations**: Multiple, including [HL7](https://www.hl7.org/), [IHE](https://www.ihe.net/), and [DirectTrust](https://www.directtrust.org/).
- **Implementation Guides**: The [US Core Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/index.html) is widely used.
- **Terminology Services**: Currently, there is no national FHIR terminology server available, nor plans for one.

## Active Use Cases for FHIR

FHIR standards in the US cover a wide range of healthcare data exchange scenarios:

- Prescriptions / Pharmacy
- Referrals / Continuity of care
- Provider directory
- Public Health Reporting
- Diagnostic Orders/Reports
- Consent
- Clinical Decision Support
- Imaging
- Immunizations

These cases show FHIR's versatility in addressing various healthcare data interoperability needs.

## Who's Using FHIR

FHIR is being adopted by a diverse set of organizations across the healthcare ecosystem:

- **Care Providers & EHR System Vendors**: Actively implementing FHIR for better interoperability.
- **App Developers**: Leveraging FHIR to create innovative healthcare applications.

The primary reasons for FHIR adoption include regulatory requirements and the desire to improve healthcare outcomes and access to information.

## Success Stories and Challenges

While there are clear benefits to FHIR adoption, such as lowered costs and improved access to information, challenges remain:

- **Benefits**: Better access to healthcare information and improved care workflows.
- **Challenges**: High investment costs and a lack of clear understanding of FHIR's benefits.

The survey underscores the need for more education on FHIR and its potential impact on healthcare.

## Future Plans for FHIR

The United States is on a path towards expanded adoption of FHIR, with new standards being developed for specific use cases and a push for wider adoption across the healthcare ecosystem. However, progress has been slower than expected, leading to some dissatisfaction with the current rate of FHIR adoption. Looking ahead, stakeholders remain neutral about the immediate benefits but acknowledge the potential for significant cost savings and enhanced care coordination in the long term.
