**In Guatemala**, the adoption of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for exchanging healthcare data is in its early stages. Currently, the use of FHIR stands at a basic level, with versions DSTU2, STU3, and R4 being explored, but with limited implementation. Respondents expect an increase in the adoption of FHIR in the coming years, indicating a growing interest in its potential to improve healthcare data exchange.

## Rules and Support

- **Health Data Exchange Rules**: There are no specific regulations mandating the use of standards for electronic health data exchange in Guatemala.
- **FHIR Requirements**: No requirements or regulations specifically mention FHIR.
- **Deadlines and Fines**: No deadlines or fines are imposed for non-compliance since there are no regulations in place.
- **Available Funding**: Government funds to stimulate the adoption of FHIR are not available, reflecting the nascent stage of FHIR adoption in the country.

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization**: Guatemala does not have a national organization responsible for health data standards. One respondent mentioned RECAINSA, but no further details or links were provided.
- **Implementation Guides**: There are no base/core FHIR implementation guides specific to Guatemala.
- **Terminology Services**: No national FHIR terminology server is available, and there are no plans for one.

## Active Use Cases

- Local implementations and pilot projects are being considered, with specific interest in diagnostic images.
- Use of international FHIR standards or guides is not specified.
- Key projects include launching pilot projects with selected healthcare stakeholders, although details are limited.

## Who's Using FHIR

- **Active Organizations**: Care providers and diagnostic system vendors are engaging with FHIR to some extent. Specific roles include IT project management and digital health project coordination.
- **Main Reasons for Adoption**: Interest in FHIR stems from its potential to drive innovation, though actual implementations are not widely reported.
- **Usage**: FHIR is being explored for various applications, including REST API and messaging, but widespread use is not yet evident.

## Success Stories and Challenges

- **Benefits**: One response highlighted data protection as a successful FHIR use case, suggesting an awareness of FHIR's potential to improve healthcare outcomes and access to information.
- **Real Examples**: Specific examples of FHIR in action are limited, indicating the early stage of adoption in Guatemala.
- **Main Difficulties**: Challenges include unclear benefits and regulations, lack of FHIR knowledge, and changes in political direction.
- **Future Plans**: Respondents are looking forward to their own projects and anticipate significant cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a robust digital health ecosystem through FHIR adoption.

## Future Plans

- **Progress So Far**: Responses indicate that progress in FHIR adoption has varied, with some reporting less progress than expected and others more.
- **Next Steps**: Plans include the development of new FHIR standards for specific use cases and the establishment of a national standards organization.
- **Expected Changes**: There is optimism about the benefits of FHIR adoption in the coming years, including cost savings and improved healthcare coordination.
