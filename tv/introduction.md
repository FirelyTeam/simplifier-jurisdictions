**In Tuvalu**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is currently not being used to exchange healthcare data. As a modern standard designed to enable healthcare information to be available, discoverable, and understandable globally, its adoption is crucial for improving healthcare outcomes. Despite the current absence of FHIR usage, there is an expectation for an increase in the rate of adoption in the coming years. The expectation is set at a significant pace, marked by a score of 5 out of a possible range, indicating optimism for FHIR's future integration.

## Rules and Support

- **Health Data Exchange Rules:** Currently, there are no regulations in place that mandate the use of standards in electronic health data exchange in Tuvalu. 
- **FHIR Requirements:** With no specific mention of FHIR in any existing regulation, the country is yet to set a clear path for FHIR adoption.
- **Deadlines and Compliance:** There are no deadlines or fines imposed for non-compliance, as regulations specifically mentioning FHIR do not exist.
- **Available Funding:** No government funds are available to stimulate the adoption of FHIR, indicating a need for strategic development in this area.

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization:** No national organization is responsible for health data standards in Tuvalu.
- **Implementation Guides:** There are no base/core FHIR implementation guides available for the country.
- **Terminology Services:** A national FHIR terminology server is in planning but not yet available.

## Active Use Cases

Currently, there are no successful FHIR use cases in Tuvalu. The anticipated integration of Taiwan HIS with Tamanu is a key project to look forward to, indicating the beginning of FHIR implementation efforts.

## Who's Using FHIR

- **Active Organizations:** The main stakeholders looking forward to FHIR implementation include healthcare providers, EHR system vendors, and diagnostic system vendors like Imaging/Lab.
- **Main Reasons for Adoption:** The expected benefits from FHIR adoption include improving health outcomes, care workflows, and fostering innovation in the healthcare sector.
- **Usage of FHIR:** The usage is currently non-existent but planning towards integrating systems suggests an imminent change.

## Success Stories and Challenges

- **Benefits:** While specific success stories are not available, the anticipated benefits include significant cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a more robust digital health ecosystem.
- **Challenges:** High investment costs, unclear benefits, unclear regulations, lack of FHIR knowledge, and changes in political direction are the main difficulties facing FHIR adoption in Tuvalu.
- **Future Plans:** The integration of Taiwan HIS with Tamanu is a specific use case being looked forward to, marking the beginning of FHIR implementation.

## Future Plans

- **Progress So Far:** FHIR is at the planning stage in Tuvalu, with no current usage.
- **Next Steps:** Developing a national FHIR data model and planning a national FHIR terminology server are immediate next steps.
- **Expected Changes:** Within the next three years, there is anticipation for significant benefits from FHIR adoption, including cost savings and improved healthcare coordination.
