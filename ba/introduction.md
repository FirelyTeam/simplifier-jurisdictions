**In Bosnia and Herzegovina**, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard is currently being used at a basic level for healthcare data exchange. Active versions include R4, R4B, and R5, with moderate utilization, while R6 (pre-release) sees limited use. The country expects to see a significant increase in the adoption rate of FHIR in the upcoming years, indicating a growing recognition of its benefits for healthcare data interoperability.

## Rules and Support

- **Health Data Exchange Rules:**
  - There are regulations in place mandating the use of standards for electronic health data exchange.
  - FHIR is specifically advised in these regulations.
- **FHIR Requirements:**
  - No specific deadline for compliance is included in the regulation.
  - No fines are imposed for non-compliance before any deadline.
- **Available Funding:**
  - Currently, there are no government funds available to stimulate the adoption of FHIR.

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization:** No national organization is currently responsible for health data standards in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
- **Implementation Guides:** There are no base/core FHIR implementation guides available for the country.
- **Terminology Services:** While a national FHIR terminology server is not available, it is in planning stages.

## Active Use Cases

- **Local Implementations:** Specific use cases developed in Bosnia and Herzegovina include Referrals/Continuity of Care, Diagnostic Orders/Reports, Document Exchange, Imaging, and Patient Access.
- **International Standards Use:** European Implementation Guides are being utilized.
- **Key Projects:** Notable projects include patient portals and integration of diagnostic imaging and laboratory systems.

## Who's Using FHIR

- Active organizations integrating FHIR into their operations include Electronic Health Record (EHR) system vendors, diagnostic system vendors (such as Imaging/Lab), and app developers.
- **Main Reasons for Adoption:**
  - Regulation and grants
  - Innovation
- **How They're Using FHIR:** Utilization focuses on FHIR Messaging, Documents, Rest API, and Bulk Data capabilities.

## Success Stories and Challenges

- **Clear Benefits:**
  - Improved healthcare outcomes
  - Enhanced access to information
  - Streamlined care workflows
- **Real Examples:** Patient portals and seamless diagnostic imaging and laboratory integration stand out as successful FHIR use cases.
- **Main Difficulties:**
  - Unclear regulations
  - Lack of FHIR knowledge among stakeholders
- **Future Plans:** There is anticipation for national-level integration and data exchange to expand.

## Future Plans

- **Progress So Far:** The country has made more progress than expected in the last year regarding FHIR adoption.
- **Next Steps:** Plans include the development of a national FHIR data model and the launch of pilot projects with selected healthcare stakeholders.
- **Expected Changes:** Within the next three years, significant benefits from FHIR adoption are anticipated, including cost savings, improved care coordination, and a more robust digital health ecosystem.
