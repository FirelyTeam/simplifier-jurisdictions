**In Japan**, the adoption of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is currently in its early stages, with a growing interest in its potential to improve healthcare data exchange. FHIR allows healthcare information to be available, discoverable, and understandable globally, and supports a wide range of applications, including electronic health records (EHRs), mobile apps, and data analysis tools. The versions of FHIR currently in use include DSTU2, STU3, with a notable interest in R4, indicating a progression towards more recent standards. Expectations are set for an increased rate of adoption in the coming years, reflecting an optimistic outlook on FHIR's role in Japan's healthcare IT landscape.

## Rules and Support

- **Health Data Exchange Rules**: Regulations mandate the use of standards in electronic health data exchange.
- **FHIR Requirements**: The regulations specifically advise the use of FHIR.
- **Deadlines**: There are no specified deadlines for compliance with these regulations.
- **Available Funding**: Government funds are available to stimulate the adoption of FHIR, with initiatives like the "Ministry EHR data sharing service" being mentioned.

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization**: Currently, there is no national organization responsible for health data standards in Japan.
- **Implementation Guides**: A base/core FHIR implementation guide is in use for a limited set of use cases, although specific URLs were not provided.
- **Terminology Services**: Plans are underway for establishing a national FHIR terminology server, enhancing the consistency and interoperability of health data.

## Active Use Cases

- Local implementations focus on:
  - Prescriptions/Pharmacy
  - Referrals/Continuity of care
  - Public Health Reporting
  - Document Exchange
  - International Patient Summary
- These use cases highlight areas where FHIR is actively contributing to improved healthcare data exchange and interoperability.

## Who's Using FHIR

- **Active Organizations**: EHR system vendors are currently engaged with FHIR, highlighting the technology's role in advancing health IT solutions.
- **Reasons for Adoption**: The main motivations include regulatory compliance and the potential to improve healthcare outcomes and data exchange efficiency.

## Success Stories and Challenges

- **Benefits**: While specific success stories were not detailed, the expected benefits of FHIR include significant cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a more robust digital health ecosystem.
- **Main Difficulties**: High investment costs and unclear regulations are noted barriers to FHIR adoption.
- **Future Plans**: Anticipated projects include the implementation of the International Patient Summary (IPS) and FHIR bulk data use cases.

## Future Plans

- **Progress So Far**: Japan has made "quite the progress" expected in the last year regarding FHIR adoption.
- **Next Steps**: The development of a national FHIR data model and expanded adoption across the healthcare ecosystem are key focus areas.
- **Expected Changes**: Over the next three years, significant benefits from FHIR adoption are anticipated, including cost savings and improved healthcare coordination.
