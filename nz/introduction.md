**In New Zealand**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is increasingly being used to exchange healthcare data. Active versions include R4, with a notable use level of '5', indicating strong utilization, while R4B and earlier versions see varied use. The country anticipates further adoption of FHIR in the coming years, driven by regulatory support and growing recognition of its benefits for healthcare data interoperability.

## Rules and Support

- **Health Data Exchange Rules:**
  - Regulations mandate the use of standards for electronic health data exchange.
  - FHIR is specifically recommended by these regulations.
- **FHIR Requirements and Deadlines:**
  - No specific deadline for compliance.
  - No fines for non-compliance before a deadline.
- **Funding:**
  - Currently, no government funds are available to stimulate FHIR adoption.
- **Regulatory Details:**
  - [Interoperability Roadmap](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/assets/Our-health-system/Digital-health/Health-information-standards/HISO-10083-2020-Interoperability-Roadmap.pdf)

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization:** Yes, New Zealand has a national organization responsible for health data standards.
  - [Health Information Standards Organisation (HISO)](https://tewhatuora.govt.nz/health-services-and-programmes/digital-health/data-and-digital-standards/health-information-standards-organisation-hiso)
- **Implementation Guides:**
  - A base/core FHIR implementation guide is available and used in a limited set of use cases.
    - [Base FHIR Implementation Guide](https://fhir.org.nz/ig/base/index.html)
- **Terminology Services:**
  - A national FHIR terminology server is in production.

## Active Use Cases

- **Local Implementations:**
  - Prescriptions / Pharmacy
  - Provider Directory
  - Terminology
  - Immunizations
  - International Patient Summary
- **International Standards Use:**
  - New Zealand utilizes international FHIR standards for specific use cases like patient summaries and pharmacy prescriptions.
- **Key Projects:**
