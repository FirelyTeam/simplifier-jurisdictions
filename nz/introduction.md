*The following is based on the answers to the [State of FHIR survey 2023](https://fire.ly/blog/fhir-maturity-and-adoption-around-the-world/) including from Alastair Kenworthy and Peter Jordan, Health New Zealand.*

## Regulation

New Zealand has embraced FHIR through the HISO 10083:2020 Interoperability Roadmap, mandating FHIR as a standard for health data exchange. While no specific compliance deadlines or fines are outlined, the government health agency, Te Whatu Ora | Health NZ, strongly supports FHIR use across the health sector.

## National Standards Development

Health New Zealand operates HISO, which acts as the regulator and standards setter for the country. A national FHIR data model is actively being used in a range of applications, with detailed information and documentation available on the [New Zealand FHIR Registry](https://fhir.org.nz/ig/base/index.html). The national interoperability roadmap emphasizes the adoption of FHIR, SNOMED, and the International Patient Summary (IPS) across healthcare.

## FHIR Implementation

The adoption of FHIR in New Zealand is growing, with various successful use cases such as the National Health Index (NHI) and Health Provider Index (HPI) FHIR APIs. There is a concerted effort for the New Zealand adaptation of IPS and other initiatives aimed at improving care and fostering innovation in health technology.

Patient advocacy groups like the WhƒÅnau, Consumer and Clinician Digital Council are engaged in healthcare data availability, but not specifically in FHIR advocacy. Nonetheless, the health sector recognizes the value of FHIR in facilitating improved access to information.

Challenges such as unclear regulations, lack of FHIR knowledge, and a dearth of experienced implementers are acknowledged. Despite these, significant public and private sector implementations provide a solid foundation for patient directory, provider directory, medication data, and terminology services at a national level.

Health NZ is looking forward to expanding FHIR applications in immunizations, care plans, medicines, and more, reflecting a robust commitment to advancing healthcare interoperability.

*HL7 New Zealand and other stakeholders within the health sector are integral to the comprehensive adoption and evolution of FHIR in the country.*
