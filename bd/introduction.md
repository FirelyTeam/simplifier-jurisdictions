**In Bangladesh**, the use of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for exchanging healthcare data is in its early stages. FHIR is a standard describing data formats and elements (known as "resources") and an application programming interface (API) for exchanging electronic health records (EHR). The survey indicates a low level of FHIR usage currently, with only DSTU2 and STU3 versions actively being mentioned. Respondents expect a significant increase in FHIR adoption in the coming years across the country.

## Rules and Support for Health Data Exchange
- **Regulation**: There's no specific regulation mandating the use of standards in electronic health data exchange currently in place.
- **FHIR Requirements**: No detailed FHIR requirements are mentioned due to the absence of specific regulations.
- **Deadlines and Fines**: There are no deadlines or fines imposed for non-compliance, as regulations are not specified.
- **Funding**: Government funds are available to stimulate the adoption of FHIR. More information about these regulations and funds can be found [here](https://en.info.shr.dghs.gov.bd/about/).

## National Setup
- **Standards Organization**: There's no national organization responsible for health data standards currently established.
- **Implementation Guides**: A base/core FHIR implementation guide for Bangladesh is under development but not officially published yet. Preliminary information can be found [here](https://info.shr.dghs.gov.bd/).
- **Terminology Services**: A national FHIR terminology server is in development, aiming to support standardized and interoperable health data exchange.

## Active Use Cases
- **Local Implementations**: Efforts are being made to implement Shared Health Records, although challenges persist due to people's mindset and other barriers.
- **International Standards Use**: There is interest in using international patient summaries and learning from successful FHIR use cases in other countries.
- **Key Projects**: The Ministry of Health seeks to deploy a central FHIR server and set up a terminology service with available funds.

## Who's Using FHIR
- **Organizations**: Management Information System (MIS), DGHS, MOHFW, and Bangladesh University of Health Sciences (BUHS) are notable entities working with FHIR.
- **Reasons for Adoption**: Improving health outcomes, care workflows, and facilitating innovation are primary motivations.
- **Application**: FHIR is utilized for messaging, documents exchange, and through APIs, including SMART on FHIR for app development.

## Success Stories and Challenges
- **Benefits**: Though specific success stories are not mentioned, anticipated benefits include better health system planning, resource mobilization, and improved healthcare outcomes.
- **Challenges**: High investment costs, unclear benefits, regulations, lack of knowledge, and people's mindset are significant barriers.
- **Future Plans**: Stakeholders are looking forward to learning from successful cases in other countries and are planning pilot projects to expand FHIR adoption.

## Future Plans
- **Progress So Far**: Adoption has made less progress than expected, with stakeholders expressing dissatisfaction but also strong belief in significant future benefits.
- **Next Steps**: Continued development of national FHIR standards, establishment of a standards organization, and launching pilot projects are immediate priorities.
- **Expected Changes**: Enhanced care coordination, cost savings, and a robust digital health ecosystem are strongly anticipated outcomes within the next three years.
