*The following is based on the answers to the [State of FHIR survey 2023](https://fire.ly/blog/fhir-maturity-and-adoption-around-the-world/) from Sheridan Cook, Accenture, and Attila Farkas, Canada Health Infoway.*

## Regulation

While Canada does not have a federal mandate for health exchange standards, provincial regulations are progressively incorporating standards, signaling a positive shift towards a unified approach to health data exchange. The absence of stringent regulations offers flexibility and adaptability in the adoption of FHIR. Notably, initiatives like the Digital Health Interoperability Program, supported by Health Canada's funding, are paving the way for improvements in health information management, indirectly benefiting FHIR's integration.

## National Standards Development

Under the stewardship of Canada Health Infoway, the national FHIR data model development signifies a commitment to advancing healthcare interoperability. The publication of the pan-Canadian FHIR data model for the Patient Summary domain and the ongoing development of CA Core+ are milestones that reflect collaborative efforts and a clear direction towards a cohesive health data framework. These developments are accessible through the [Canadian FHIR Registry](https://simplifier.net/organization/canadianfhirregistry/~projects).

## FHIR Implementation

The adoption of FHIR is gaining momentum among key stakeholders such as EHR vendors, app developers, and health information systems, demonstrating a robust ecosystem for FHIR implementation. Success stories, like the PrescribeIT ePrescribing standard, illustrate tangible benefits in cost reduction, improved healthcare outcomes, and enhanced information accessibility. With patient advocacy groups underscoring the importance of healthcare data availability, the environment is ripe for FHIR to flourish further. The future holds promising developments, including eReferral and primary care data exchange, aligning with international interoperability trends.
