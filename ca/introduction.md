**In Canada**, the adoption of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is currently at a moderate level, with the most active version being R4, indicating some use in healthcare data exchange. Other versions like DSTU2, STU3, and R5 are less utilized, with R4B and pre-release R6 not clearly defined in their adoption. Respondents expect the adoption rate of FHIR to increase in the coming years, highlighting a positive outlook for FHIR's role in enhancing healthcare interoperability in Canada.

## Rules and Support

- **Health Data Exchange Rules**: Currently, there are no regulations mandating the use of standards for electronic health data exchange, including FHIR.
- **FHIR Requirements**: Specific mentions of FHIR in regulations were not provided.
- **Deadlines and Fines**: No deadlines or fines are imposed for non-compliance since regulations are not explicitly mandating FHIR.
- **Available Funding**: Government funds are available to stimulate FHIR adoption, with Infoway & CIHI, along with some provincial governments, actively investing in initiatives.

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization**: Canada has a national organization responsible for health data standards, known as [Canada Health Infoway](https://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/).
- **Implementation Guides**: A base/core FHIR implementation guide is in place, used in a limited set of use cases, available at [Simplifier.net/CA-Core](https://simplifier.net/CA-Core).
- **Terminology Services**: A national FHIR terminology server is operational and in production.

## Active Use Cases

- **Local Implementations**: 
  - Prescriptions/Pharmacy
  - Referrals/Continuity of care
  - Document Exchange
  - Immunizations
  - Provider Directory
  - International Patient Summary
  - International Patient Access

- **International Standards Use**: Canada utilizes FHIR for international patient summaries and access, indicating a commitment to global health data interoperability.

- **Key Projects**: Specific names and links to key projects were not provided, but the involvement in prescriptions, referrals, and document exchange suggests a focus on critical areas of healthcare.

## Who's Using FHIR

- **Active Organizations**: Care providers and jurisdictional systems are the primary users of FHIR in Canada.
- **Main Reasons for Adoption**: 
  - Improving health outcomes
  - Innovation
  - Improved data access
- **How They're Using FHIR**: Use cases include messaging, documents, REST API, and SMART on FHIR, with moderate to high usage rates in these areas.

## Success Stories and Challenges

- **Benefits**: The anticipated benefits of FHIR adoption include significant cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a more robust digital health ecosystem.
- **Real Examples**: Specific success stories were not provided.
- **Main Difficulties**: 
  - Unclear regulations
  - Lack of FHIR knowledge
- **Future Plans**: Respondents look forward to the development of a national FHIR data model and new regulations prescribing the use of standards in health data exchange.

## Future Plans

- **Progress So Far**: There has been less progress than expected in the last year regarding FHIR adoption.
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Development of a national FHIR data model
  - New regulation that prescribes the use of standards in electronic health data exchange
  - Expanded adoption of FHIR across the healthcare ecosystem
- **Expected Changes**: Within the next three years, significant benefits from FHIR adoption are anticipated, including cost savings and enhanced care coordination.
