**In Greece**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is beginning to shape the way healthcare data is exchanged. Currently, its adoption is at a nascent stage, with a score of 2 out of 5 indicating early phases of use. The versions R4 and R5 of FHIR are notably recognized, with R4 having a modest adoption (scored 3) and R5 being more anticipated (scored 4). The expectation for FHIR adoption in the coming years is positive, with a score of 4 suggesting growing optimism.

## Rules and Support

- **Health Data Exchange Rules:**
  - FHIR is advised in regulations for electronic health data exchange.
  - Specific regulations are in place mandating the use of standards like FHIR.
- **FHIR Requirements:**
  - The regulation explicitly mentions FHIR.
- **Deadlines and Compliance:**
  - No strict deadlines for compliance.
  - Uncertainty around fines for non-compliance.
- **Funding:**
  - Currently, no government funds are available to support FHIR adoption.
  - Upcoming regulations and digital reform tenders may change this scenario.

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization:** 
  - Greece currently has no national organization responsible for health data standards.
- **Implementation Guides:** 
  - A base/core FHIR implementation guide is under development.
- **Terminology Services:** 
  - A national FHIR terminology server is planned but not yet available.

## Active Use Cases

- **Local Implementations:**
  - Specific use cases developed include Prescriptions/Pharmacy, Referrals/Continuity of care, Terminology, Diagnostic Orders/Reports, Document Exchange, Imaging, and Immunizations.
- **International Standards Use:**
  - European Implementation Guides are being adopted.

## Who's Using FHIR

- **Active Organizations:**
  - Care providers, payers/insurers, EHR system vendors, diagnostic system vendors (like Imaging/Lab), and app developers are actively involved.
- **Main Reasons for Adoption:**
  - Regulation and grants, innovation, and development of new FHIR standards for specific use cases.
- **Usage of FHIR:**
  - While specifics on how each sector is using FHIR are not detailed, the engagement across a broad spectrum suggests a foundational effort to integrate FHIR into multiple facets of healthcare information technology.

## Success Stories and Challenges

- **Benefits:**

## Future Plans

- **Progress So Far:**
  - Greece has made "quite the progress expected" in the last year regarding FHIR adoption.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Development of a national FHIR data model and new FHIR standards for specific use cases.
  - Launch of pilot projects with selected healthcare stakeholders.
- **Expected Changes:**
  - In the next three years, significant benefits from FHIR adoption are anticipated, including cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a robust digital health ecosystem.
