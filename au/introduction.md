*The following is based on the answers to the [State of FHIR survey 2023](https://fire.ly/blog/fhir-maturity-and-adoption-around-the-world/) from Kate Ebrill, Director at HL7 Australia and Interoperability Lead at CSIRO.*

## Regulation

Australia currently does not have a specific regulation mandating the use of FHIR for electronic health data exchange. However, the Department of Health and Aged Care has shown commitment towards supporting FHIR, particularly with plans for a National auCore Implementation Guide (IG) and a FHIR Management Framework. While there are no fines mentioned for non-compliance, funds have been allocated in the budget to support FHIR development efforts.

## National Standards Development

The Australian Digital Health Agency, Department of Health and Aged Care, CSIRO, and HL7 Australia are key organizations involved in national standards development. They are working towards the establishment of a FHIR Management Framework, which includes a FHIR Community Process and a FHIR Governance Group, as well as a national accelerator program for National IDs. The national FHIR data model is under development and can be found at [HL7 Australia's FHIR Core page](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/). This model forms the basis for several specific use case standards being developed.

## FHIR Implementation

FHIR adoption in Australia is set to grow, with the expectation of improved healthcare outcomes and access to information. The Australian healthcare community is anticipating the MyHR Modernisation Program, e-Requesting, and SMART HealthChecks. While there is enthusiasm for innovation and improved care, challenges like unclear regulations and a lack of FHIR knowledge persist. Successful use cases, such as the National Clinical Terminology Service and cancer screening registries, demonstrate the potential of FHIR to lower costs and improve information access.

*Patient advocacy in Australia does not specifically focus on health data standards, and the rate of FHIR adoption is currently moderate. The community looks forward to more explicit benefits as FHIR continues to be implemented in various healthcare scenarios.*
