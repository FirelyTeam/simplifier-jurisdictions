*The following is based on the answers to the [State of FHIR survey 2023](https://fire.ly/blog/fhir-maturity-and-adoption-around-the-world/) from Victor Medina, HL7 Mexico.*

## Regulation

Mexico's official standard NOM-024-2012 guides the use of electronic health data exchange but does not specifically mention FHIR. There are no apparent deadlines for compliance nor fines for not meeting any potential standards. Despite this, the National Digital Strategy has proposed improvements for digital transformation in the health sector, which could provide opportunities for the implementation of FHIR in the future.

## National Standards Development

The Asociación para la promoción de la interoperabilidad en salud (APIS) is involved in the promotion of interoperability standards, including FHIR. Although a national FHIR data model is reportedly under development, it has not yet been published. There are no specific FHIR standards developed for particular use cases in Mexico as of the survey response, indicating that FHIR is in the nascent stages of adoption.

## FHIR Implementation

Currently, FHIR is not widely used in Mexico's healthcare data exchange. However, there is recognition of the need for innovation in health IT, and organizations like HL7 Mexico are likely to play a crucial role in the development and advocacy for FHIR standards. 

While patient advocacy groups, such as Accountability Lab, are active in promoting the availability of healthcare data, they do not specifically focus on FHIR or other health data standards.

Challenges such as unclear benefits, regulations, and a lack of knowledge about FHIR persist. However, there is optimism for future FHIR implementation use cases, signaling a growing interest in enhancing healthcare interoperability.

*The state of FHIR in Mexico is poised for development, with key stakeholders eager to explore its potential to improve healthcare outcomes and access to information.*
