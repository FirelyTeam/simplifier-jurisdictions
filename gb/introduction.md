*The following is based on the answers to the [State of FHIR survey 2023](https://fire.ly/blog/fhir-maturity-and-adoption-around-the-world/) from Rik Smithies, HL7 UK.*

The United Kingdom is advancing its healthcare interoperability with the development of FHIR standards.

## Regulation

Healthcare policy in the UK tends to be directed by the NHS with some government oversight. While there is no strict mandate for the use of FHIR, there is an indication that FHIR standards are being drafted, known as the UK Core. This reflects a growing recognition within the healthcare system of the importance of interoperability and the potential of FHIR to contribute to this aim.

## National Standards Development

HL7 UK is the key standards organization in the UK, currently working on the development of a national FHIR data model. The draft of this model can be found on [Simplifier](https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide/Home?version=1.0.0). Although other FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) have been implemented, these are not yet recognized as national standards. The ongoing development of UK-specific standards indicates a tailored approach to adopting FHIR, considering the unique requirements of the UK's healthcare system.

## FHIR Implementation

Several successful FHIR use cases in the UK, such as the Kings Health Partnership in London, SiDER in Somerset, and the Yorkshire & Humber Care Record, showcase the improved access to information facilitated by FHIR. Looking ahead, there are projects in the pipeline that will reimplement national-level patient demographics services in FHIR and develop national-level pathology standards using FHIR in Wales and England. The anticipated release of the UK Core is expected to boost FHIR adoption across the UK.

*Key stakeholders in the UK include the NHS health informatics bodies from England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, along with HL7 UK, which can provide further contact information. Their collaborative efforts are central to achieving a comprehensive and effective FHIR adoption strategy in the UK.*
