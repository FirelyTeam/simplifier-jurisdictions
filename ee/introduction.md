*The following is based on the answers to the [State of FHIR survey 2023](https://fire.ly/blog/fhir-maturity-and-adoption-around-the-world/) from Ragne Õitspuu, TEHIK.*

## Regulation

Estonia has a well-established regulation for health data exchange within the National Health Information System since 2008, articulated through the Tervishoiuteenuste korraldamise seadus ([Health Services Organization Act](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/510042023001/consolide)). This legislation does not specifically mention FHIR, but Estonia is currently transitioning from Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) to FHIR. The change in standards is guided by national eHealth roadmap and strategy documents, suggesting a gradual and planned shift with existing regulations expected to persist.

## National Standards Development

TEHIK, the Estonian Health and Welfare Information Systems Centre, is the primary national standards organization overseeing most health data exchange standards. A national FHIR data model is under development and partially published on [Simplifier.net](https://simplifier.net/guide/ee-fhir-base?version=current). There are several FHIR standards for specific use cases evolving from this data model, in line with Estonia’s approach to implementing an information model layer for healthcare data.

## FHIR Implementation

The adoption of FHIR is expected to grow substantially, with a strategic transition from CDA to FHIR. This gradual transition will allow both standards to be used concurrently for the foreseeable future, ensuring a smooth adaptation for various stakeholders. Successful FHIR implementations include the Clinical Data Viewer by TEHIK and data exchanges with the European Medicines Agency's Union Product Database, showcasing improved healthcare outcomes and information access. 

Estonia is looking forward to implementing new use cases within the National Health Information System, such as medication schemas, laboratory data, and referrals. Despite challenges like a lack of widespread FHIR knowledge, there is optimism for broader implementation, evidenced by regulation, grants, and innovation efforts.

*Notable stakeholders in the FHIR adoption process include HL7 Estonia (in application), various vendors like Kodality and Nortal, and organizations such as the State Agency of Medicines, Health Insurance Fund, and the Ministry of Social Affairs.*
