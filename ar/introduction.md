*The following is based on the answers to the [State of FHIR survey 2023](https://fire.ly/blog/fhir-maturity-and-adoption-around-the-world/) from Fernando Campos, HL7 Argentina.*

## Regulation

Argentina is advancing in healthcare digitalization with the implementation of FHIR advised under Ley 27706, the federal program for the digitization of clinical histories. While there is no compliance deadline or fines for non-adherence, the Red Nacional de Salud Digital ([National Digital Health Network](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/salud/digital/red)) and the standards documentation ([Digital Health Standards](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/salud/digital/estandares)) indicate the government's support for FHIR. Additionally, an [Implementation Guide](https://guias.hl7.org.ar/site/index.html) is available to assist with the adoption of FHIR.

## National Standards Development

The national standards organization DNSI - Direccion Nacional Sistemas Informacion is playing a crucial role in the adoption and development of FHIR standards in Argentina. A national FHIR data model has been developed and is being used in a limited number of use cases, available at [Argentina's FHIR Core](https://bus.msal.gob.ar/fhir/ar/core/site/index.html). Several FHIR standards are emerging, most of which are aligned with this data model, indicating a coordinated effort in national standards development.

## FHIR Implementation

The rate of FHIR adoption is expected to increase, with current applications in areas such as ePrescriptions and patient identification. These implementations showcase the potential for lowering costs and improving both healthcare outcomes and access to information. Initiatives like the development of standards for patient consent, immunization data, and orders are anticipated, reflecting a commitment to improving care through technology.

Challenges such as unclear regulations and a general lack of knowledge about FHIR persist. However, the ongoing efforts by care providers, insurers, and the Ministry of Salud (Ministry of Health) suggest a positive trajectory for FHIR's future in Argentina.

*Patient advocacy does not specifically target health data standards, but there is a growing recognition of the importance of such standards in facilitating improved care.*
