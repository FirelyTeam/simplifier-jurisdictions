**In Argentina**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is beginning to play a significant role in healthcare data exchange. Currently, versions R4 and R4B are actively used, indicating a focus on newer standards of this global framework designed to enable healthcare information interoperability. There's an expectation of increased adoption in the coming years, signaling a positive outlook for FHIR's role in enhancing healthcare data exchange and integration in Argentina.

## Rules and Support
- **Health Data Exchange Regulations**: As of now, there are no specific regulations mandating the use of FHIR standards for electronic health data exchange in Argentina.
- **FHIR Requirements**: No specific FHIR-related requirements are mentioned in current regulations.
- **Funding**: There are no government funds available specifically aimed at stimulating the adoption of FHIR.
- **Regulation Details**: A notable regulation, Resolution 115/2019, establishes the National Network of Health Interoperability and the Registry of Health Interoperability Domains. [Resolution 115/2019](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/normativa/nacional/resoluci%C3%B3n-115-2019-319286)

## National Setup
- **Standards Organization**: Currently, there is no national organization in Argentina responsible for health data standards.
- **Implementation Guides**: Argentina has a base/core FHIR implementation guide being used in limited use cases, available at [HL7 Argentina Guides](https://guias.hl7.org.ar/site/index.html).
- **Terminology Services**: There is no national FHIR terminology server available yet, but there are plans to establish one.

## Active Use Cases
- **Local Implementations**: E-prescription is highlighted as a successful local implementation of FHIR.
- **International Standards Use**: Argentina uses FHIR in areas like Prescriptions/Pharmacy, Provider Directory, Clinical Decision Support, Document Exchange, and Immunizations.
- **Key Projects**: An upcoming project in Buenos Aires aims to implement e-prescription and document exchange for 40 million patients.

## Who's Using FHIR
- **Active Organizations**: Care providers, payers/insurers, and EHR system vendors are currently using FHIR in Argentina.
- **Main Reasons for Adoption**:
  - Improving health outcomes
  - Improving care workflows
  - Driving innovation
- **Usage of FHIR**: FHIR is mainly used through REST APIs, followed by documents, and is starting to be utilized in SMART on FHIR and CDS Hooks applications.

## Success Stories and Challenges
- **Benefits**:
  - Improved access to information
  - Enhanced care workflows through the use of ePrescription
- **Real Examples**: The ePrescription system is a noted success story.
- **Main Difficulties**:
  - Unclear regulations
  - Lack of FHIR knowledge
  - Changes in political direction
- **Future Plans**: There are ambitions to expand FHIR's adoption in Buenos Aires for ePrescription and document exchange among a large patient base.

## Future Plans
- **Progress So Far**: The progress of FHIR adoption in Argentina has been less than expected.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Development of new FHIR standards for specific use cases
  - Launch of pilot projects with selected healthcare stakeholders
  - New regulation that prescribes the use of standards in electronic health data exchange
- **Expected Changes**: There is a neutral expectation regarding the benefits of FHIR adoption in the next three years, including significant cost savings and enhanced care coordination.
