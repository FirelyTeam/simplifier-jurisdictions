**In Taiwan**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is gaining ground in healthcare data exchange. Currently, it's being used at a significant level, with a particular emphasis on the R4 version, noted for its advanced features and capabilities. The country anticipates an increased adoption rate of FHIR in the coming years, indicating a positive trajectory towards integrating this standard more comprehensively within its healthcare systems.

## Rules and Support
Taiwan has established a regulatory framework and support mechanisms to foster the adoption of FHIR standards in healthcare data exchange:
- **Health Data Exchange Regulations**: Legislation mandates the use of standards, specifically advising the use of FHIR.
- **FHIR Requirements**: The regulations explicitly endorse FHIR without setting a compliance deadline or imposing fines for non-compliance.
- **Funding**: Government funds are available to stimulate FHIR adoption. More information on these regulations and funds can be found [here](https://web.pcc.gov.tw/prkms/tender/common/bulletion/readBulletion?querySentence=FHIR&tenderStatusType=%E6%8B%9B%E6%A8%99&tenderStatusType=%E6%B1%BA%E6%A8%99&sortCol=TENDER_NOTICE_DATE&timeRange=113&pageSize=10).

## National Setup
Taiwan's efforts to standardize health data exchange include:
- **Standards Organization**: A national organization responsible for health data standards, more information available [here](https://medstandard.mohw.gov.tw/).
- **Implementation Guides**: Taiwan has a widely used base/core FHIR implementation guide, accessible [here](https://build.fhir.org/ig/cctwFHIRterm/MOHW_TWCoreIG_Build/index.html).
- **Terminology Services**: Plans are underway to establish a national FHIR terminology server.

## Active Use Cases
FHIR is being actively used in Taiwan for:
- Local implementations, including **Public Health Reporting** and **International Patient Summary**.
- Key projects that demonstrate successful FHIR use, such as:
    - [Patient Access System](https://twcore.mohw.gov.tw/ig/pas/)
    - [Electronic Medical Records](https://twcore.mohw.gov.tw/ig/emr/)

## Who's Using FHIR
FHIR adoption in Taiwan involves a diverse set of stakeholders:
- **Active Organizations**: Care providers, payers/insurers, and EHR system vendors.
- **Main Reasons for Adoption**:
    - Regulation and grants
    - Improving health outcomes
    - Enhancing care workflows
    - Driving innovation
- **Usage**: Primarily for messaging, Rest API, and developing new standards for specific use cases.

## Success Stories and Challenges
Taiwan has experienced clear benefits from FHIR adoption, including **improved healthcare outcomes** and **access to information**. However, challenges such as high investment costs, unclear benefits, and a lack of FHIR knowledge have been noted. Upcoming plans focus on overcoming these hurdles and expanding FHIR's adoption further.

## Future Plans
Taiwan has made more progress with FHIR adoption than expected and is satisfied with the current rate of adoption. The next steps include:
- Continuing the development of a national FHIR data model.
- Launching pilot projects with selected healthcare stakeholders.

Expectations for the next three years are high, with significant cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a stronger digital health ecosystem anticipated as a result of FHIR adoption.
