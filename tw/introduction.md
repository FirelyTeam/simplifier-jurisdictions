*The following is based on the answers to the [State of FHIR survey 2023](https://fire.ly/blog/fhir-maturity-and-adoption-around-the-world/).*

## Regulation

In Taiwan, FHIR adoption is actively advised by the government, which has been integrating FHIR into various projects. While there are no compulsory regulations or specific deadlines mentioned for FHIR adoption, the government provides funding for medical centers and projects to apply FHIR in practice. This includes support for TW core Implementation Guide, Terminology services, educational events, and CDA to FHIR conversion tools.

## National Standards Development

The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) supports the Project Management Office (PMO) annually, which can be run by any organization. This initiative underscores the commitment to FHIR adoption and the development of national standards. A limited set of FHIR use cases is currently being implemented, and resources are available on [TW Core IG](https://twcore.mohw.gov.tw/ig/) and [DCC FHIR IG](https://dccfhirig.mohw.gov.tw/ig/index.html), showcasing the ongoing development.

## FHIR Implementation

While the current use of FHIR in Taiwan is still emerging, 2023 marks the second year of promoting its adoption. There are a few FHIR standards developed for specific use cases, some of which derive from the national FHIR data model. The existing standard for Electronic Medical Record (EMR) exchange is the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format, with the transition to FHIR being encouraged for future interoperability.

There is acknowledgment of challenges such as high investment costs and a lack of knowledge about FHIR, which could slow the adoption rate. However, there is optimism about future FHIR implementation use cases, including public health surveillance, EHR, and insurance claims, indicating a trajectory towards more extensive FHIR utilization.

*The Ministry of Health and Welfare, alongside various stakeholders including hospitals and health IT vendors, are the main drivers of FHIR adoption in Taiwan.*
