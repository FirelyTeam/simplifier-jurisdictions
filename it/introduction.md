**In Italy**, the use of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for exchanging healthcare data is growing. Currently, it holds a moderate level of usage with a score of 3 out of 5, indicating that it's in active development and adoption phases. The most used version of FHIR is R4, rated at 5 out of 5, followed by R4B at a score of 4, showing a clear preference and progression towards newer standards. The expectation for FHIR adoption in Italy is positive, with a forecast of increased usage in the coming years.

## Rules and Support

- **Health Data Exchange Rules**
  - There is regulation in place mandating the use of standards for electronic health data exchange.
  - FHIR is specifically mentioned and mandated in these regulations.
  - No deadlines are imposed for compliance, nor are there fines for non-compliance.
- **Support and Funding**
  - Government funds are available to stimulate the adoption of FHIR.
  - Key regulations and funding sources include the Ecosistema Dati Sanitari (Italian EHDS) and the Italian PNRR (National Recovery and Resilience Plan). Further information can be found on their respective platforms.

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization**
  - Italy has a national organization responsible for health data standards, HL7 Italy. [HL7 Italy](https://www.hl7.it/)
- **Implementation Guides**
  - A base/core FHIR implementation guide specific to Italy is under development. [Italian FHIR Implementation Guide](https://www.hl7.it/fhir/)
- **Terminology Services**
  - While a national FHIR terminology server is not yet available, it is currently in planning.

## Active Use Cases

Italy is developing FHIR standards for various healthcare data exchanges, including:
- Prescriptions / Pharmacy
- Referrals / Continuity of care
- Terminology
- Diagnostic Orders/Reports
- Document Exchange
- European Implementation Guides

These reflect the local implementations and adherence to international standards, showcasing the flexibility and scalability of FHIR within Italy's healthcare ecosystem.

## Who's Using FHIR

Several entities are actively engaged with FHIR in Italy:
- **Care Providers** and **EHR System Vendors** are the primary users.
- The main reasons for adopting FHIR include regulation and grants, innovation, and the development of a national FHIR data model.

- **Main Difficulties**
  - Challenges include unclear benefits, unclear regulations, and a lack of FHIR knowledge.

## Future Plans

- **Progress So Far**
  - Italy has made significant strides in FHIR adoption, aligning with expectations.
- **Next Steps**
  - Development of a national FHIR data model and new standards for more specific use cases are in progress.
- **Expected Changes**
  - In the next three years, Italy anticipates significant benefits from FHIR adoption, including cost savings and enhanced care coordination.
