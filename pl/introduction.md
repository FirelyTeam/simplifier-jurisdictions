**In Poland**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is starting to make its mark in the healthcare data exchange landscape. Currently, adoption is moderate but with notable interest in the latest version, R4, indicating a readiness to embrace more advanced healthcare data standards. Expectations are set high for the coming years, with a significant push towards increased FHIR adoption, driven by regulatory requirements and the healthcare sector's demand for better interoperability.

## Rules and Support
- **Health Data Exchange Rules**: Poland has regulations mandating the use of standards in electronic health data exchange.
- **FHIR Requirements**: The regulation specifically mentions that FHIR is mandated.
- **Deadlines**: There are compliance deadlines included within these regulations.
- **Available Funding**: Currently, there are no government funds available to stimulate the adoption of FHIR.
- **Regulation Details**: One key regulation mentioned is the obligatory reporting of medical events. More information can be found on [CEZ official website](https://www.cez.gov.pl/pl/main-page-en).

## National Setup
- **Standards Organization**: The national organization responsible for health data standards in Poland is available with more details at [CEZ](https://www.cez.gov.pl/pl/main-page-en).
- **Implementation Guides**: A base/core FHIR implementation guide is under development, indicating ongoing efforts to standardize FHIR's use in Poland.
- **Terminology Services**: While there is no national FHIR terminology server yet, there are plans to establish one, highlighting the future direction of FHIR infrastructure in Poland.

## Active Use Cases
- Local implementations of FHIR in Poland cover several specific areas, including:
  - Terminology
  - Diagnostic Orders/Reports
  - Imaging
  - Provider Directory
  - International Patient Summary
  - European Implementation Guides
These areas showcase the versatility and adaptability of FHIR to various healthcare data exchange needs.
