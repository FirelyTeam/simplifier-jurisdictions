### Regulation

Belgium has robust regulations in place that specifically mandate the use of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for electronic health data exchange. The most pivotal regulation, the [EHealth Action Plan](https://www.ehealth.fgov.be/), clearly prescribes the adoption of FHIR standards. While specific compliance deadlines are not well-documented, the absence of fines for non-compliance is counterbalanced by the availability of governmental funds aimed at stimulating FHIR adoption, fostering a supportive regulatory environment.

### Adoption

The adoption of FHIR in Belgium is prominently advanced, nearing mainstream status with an overall adoption score of 4 out of 5. The prevalent use of FHIR version R4 signifies a mature implementation landscape, while the anticipation of significant growth in adoption underscores a highly optimistic trajectory for FHIR expansion in the coming years.

### Authoritative Bodies

Belgium consist of three regions (Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels) with a high degree of autonomy, however health standards are foremost managed on a federal level. The Belgian federal governement has declared that for e-health, FHIR is the ["Preferred standard to use for e-health"](https://ehealth.fgov.be/standards/fhir/about-fhir.html).

Leading the charge in the standardization and implementation of FHIR in Belgium are organizations such as [HL7 Belgium](https://www.hl7belgium.org/) and [IHE Belgium](https://ihe-europe.net/affiliates/belgium). These entities serve as central meeting grounds for various stakeholders, fostering collaboration and widespread adoption of FHIR standards across the healthcare ecosystem.

### Relevant Institutes

Key stakeholders in the adoption of FHIR include care providers, payers/insurers, EHR vendors, and app developers. The **eHealth Platform**, **RIZIV-INAMI**, and regional health vaults like **Vitalink**, **RSW**, and **RSB** have also been identified as crucial players, driving forward the national agenda on FHIR adoption.

### National Standards Development

Belgium has an active landscape for the development of FHIR standards, with several specific use cases already leveraging these standards. A national FHIR data model is under development: [HL7 Belgium FHIR specification](https://hl7-be.github.io/). While it is not yet published, it promises to further streamline and harmonize electronic health data exchange across the country.

Belgium has defined several [Implementation Guides](https://ehealth.fgov.be/standards/fhir/), ranging from Core, Vaccination, Allergy Intolerance, Medication, Clinical, national infrastructure connectivity, Lab, to security.

### Terminology Usage

In Belgium, multiple base terminologies are accepted, using both SNOMED and Loinc and ICD-10 and a few national base terminologies. And because Belgium is multi-lingual, they have a bilingual thesaurus called [3BT](https://www.health.belgium.be/nl/terminologiecentrum-terminologiestelsels-de-3bt-bilingual-biclassified-belgian-thesaurus), and is now maintained as an [extension on Snomed](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=404684003&edition=MAIN/2024-06-01&release=&languages=en,nl,fr).

### Infrastructure

Belgium boasts a well-established regional and national infrastructure that supports FHIR integration. Software companies aiming to plug into this infrastructure must meet certain technical requirements ensuring seamless interoperability and data exchange. The **FHIR Rest API** and **FHIR Shorthand** are notably widely used, indicating robust and sophisticated infrastructure capabilities.

The regional governements maintain their own infrastructure for data exchange, which they call 'Vaults':
These systems are 
- *Vitalink* (Flanders)
- *RSW* (Wallonia)
- *Brusafe+* (Brussels region)

Health companies and organizations are encouraged to addopt FHIR and connect with national infrastructure. Their principles are focused on [openness, transparency, and collaboration]( https://ehealth.fgov.be/standards/fhir/documents/20230921_FHIR_Governance_process_v2.pdf).

In conclusion, the state of FHIR in Belgium is progressive and promising. With strong regulatory backing, substantial adoption, and proactive development and infrastructure support, Belgium is well-positioned to not only standardize health data exchange but also innovate and improve healthcare outcomes significantly.
