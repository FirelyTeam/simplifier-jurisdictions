**In Belgium**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is actively used to exchange healthcare data. The country currently uses the R4 version of FHIR, indicating a modern approach to health data interoperability. There's a noticeable momentum towards increasing the adoption rate of FHIR in the coming years, with expectations of significant progress. This move is supported by regulations and incentives aiming to enhance healthcare data exchange and integration.

## National Setup
- **Standards Organization**:
  - Belgium has a national organization responsible for health data standards, accessible at [eHealth Fgov](http://www.ehealth.fgov.be/).
- **Implementation Guides**:
  - A base/core FHIR Implementation Guide is widely used and available at [eHealth Fgov Standards](https://www.ehealth.fgov.be/standards/fhir/core/index.html).
- **Terminology Services**: Information on a national FHIR terminology server is under development or not clearly mentioned.

## Active Use Cases
- Local implementations include vaccination registries and allergy information across Belgium.
- International standards, such as European Implementation Guides, are also in use.
- Key projects involve mapping hospital data to FHIR for both primary and secondary uses, enhancing interoperability between hospitals and software companies.

## Who's Using FHIR
- **Organizations**:
  - Care providers, payers/insurers, EHR system vendors, and diagnostic system vendors are actively involved.
- **Reasons for Adoption**:
  - Improving healthcare outcomes and care workflows are primary motivators.
- **Usage**:
  - FHIR is utilized through a range of applications including REST APIs, messaging, and documentation.

## Success Stories and Challenges
- **Benefits**:
  - Improved access to information and potential efficiency gains are notable benefits.
- **Real Examples**:
  - The vaccination registry is a highlighted success story.
- **Difficulties**:
  - High investment costs and lack of FHIR knowledge are main challenges.
- **Future Plans**:
  - Looking forward to person-centric health data vaults and OPAT (Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy) trajectory implementations.

## Future Plans
- Belgium has made considerable progress with FHIR adoption, aiming for expanded use across the healthcare ecosystem.
- Next steps include the development of new FHIR standards for specific use cases and launching pilot projects with healthcare stakeholders.
- Significant changes expected in the next three years include cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a robust digital health ecosystem.
