**In Cyprus**, the adoption of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for exchanging healthcare data is still in its early stages, with a primary focus on version R4. Despite this, there is a clear expectation for increased adoption in the coming years. The use of FHIR is seen as a pivotal step towards improving healthcare data interoperability within the country.

## Rules and Support for FHIR

- **Health Data Exchange Rules:** Cyprus has regulations mandating the use of standards for electronic health data exchange. However, FHIR is not explicitly mentioned in these regulations.
- **FHIR Requirements:** Despite the lack of specific mention, FHIR is expected to become a key standard for national EHR (Electronic Health Records) systems by law.
- **Deadlines and Fines:** Regulations include deadlines for compliance, with fines imposed if these are not met.
- **Funding:** Government funds are available to stimulate FHIR adoption, supported by the European Union's Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), the NCP eHealth, and direct EU funding.

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization:** Currently, there is no national organization responsible for health data standards in Cyprus.
- **Implementation Guides:** A base/core FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) for Cyprus is under development. A prototype for the Single EHR Bank of Cyprus can be found [here](https://simplifier.net/ehealth4u).
- **Terminology Services:** A national FHIR terminology server is in planning but not yet available.

## Active Use Cases

- **Local Implementations:** The eHealth4U platform serves as a prototype for the Single EHR Bank of Cyprus.
- **International Standards Use:** Cyprus is involved in the Xt-EHR project to develop implementation guides and technical specifications for adopting the European Electronic Health Record Exchange Format (EEHRxF) across various domains.
- **Key Projects:** Projects focusing on ePrescription, eDispensation, patient summaries, discharge notes, laboratory reports, and medical imaging results are underway.

## Who's Using FHIR

- **Active Organizations:** The National eHealth Authority of Cyprus (NeHA) is leading the adoption of FHIR. 
- **Main Reasons for Adoption:** The main aim is to improve interoperability, access to information, and care workflows within the healthcare system.
- **How They're Using FHIR:** FHIR is being used through the Rest API and SMART on FHIR, focusing on exchanging health data efficiently.

## Success Stories and Challenges

- **Clear Benefits:** Improved access to information and improved care workflows are cited as benefits from FHIR use cases.
- **Real Examples:** The eHealth4U platform is highlighted as a successful implementation.
- **Main Difficulties:** Challenges include a lack of FHIR knowledge and resistance to change.
- **Future Plans:** Cyprus looks forward to EU cross-border healthcare services (EU patient summary and ePrescription) and further development of the Single EHR Data Bank.

## Future Plans

- **Progress So Far:** Adoption has made less progress than expected, with current satisfaction levels being low.
- **Next Steps:** Development of a national FHIR data model and new regulations prescribing the use of standards in electronic health data exchange are in progress.
- **Expected Changes:** Significant benefits from FHIR adoption are anticipated within the next three years, including cost savings and enhanced care coordination.
