**In Austria**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is increasingly being utilized for healthcare data exchange. The adoption of FHIR versions R4, R4B, and R5 is notable, with these versions receiving a rating of '4' on a scale indicating their usage level. The country anticipates a significant increase in FHIR adoption in the coming years, reflecting optimism about its potential benefits for the healthcare system.

## Rules and Support

- **Health Data Exchange Rules:**
  - There is regulation mandating the use of standards in electronic health data exchange.
  - FHIR is not specifically mentioned in the regulation.
  - A compliance deadline is set, but no fines are imposed for non-compliance.
- **FHIR Requirements and Deadlines:**
  - While FHIR is encouraged, it's not explicitly required by current regulations.
- **Available Funding:**
  - No government funds are currently available to stimulate the adoption of FHIR.
- **Regulation Details:**
  - Law for ELGA: [https://www.elga.gv.at/faq/gesetzliche-grundlagen-von-elga/](https://www.elga.gv.at/faq/gesetzliche-grundlagen-von-elga/)

## National Setup

- **Standards Organization:**
  - HL7 Austria is responsible for health data standards. [https://hl7.at/](https://hl7.at/)
- **Implementation Guides:**
  - A widely used base/core FHIR implementation guide is available. [https://fhir.hl7.at/](https://fhir.hl7.at/)
- **Terminology Services:**
  - A national FHIR terminology server is in production, supporting standard terminologies and codes.

## Active Use Cases

- Local implementations include mobile apps for eVaccination and various vendor product implementations.
- Use of international FHIR standards like IHE Profiles based on FHIR.
- Key projects involve Prescriptions/Pharmacy, Provider Directory, Public Health Reporting, Document Exchange, Terminology, and Scheduling.

## Who's Using FHIR

- Active organizations include care providers and EHR system vendors.
- Main reasons for adoption are to improve access to information and care workflows, and to foster innovation.
- FHIR is being used for document exchange, public health reporting, and terminology services, among other applications.

## Success Stories and Challenges

- **Benefits:**
  - Improved access to information and care workflows through mobile apps and product implementations.
- **Real Examples:**
  - Mobile App for ELGA eVaccination and science programs for CQL.
- **Main Difficulties:**
  - High investment cost and the challenge of migrating existing eHealth infrastructure and data to FHIR.
- **Future Plans:**
  - Looking forward to the adoption of FHIR in ELGA and the development of new FHIR standards for specific use cases.

## Future Plans

- Austria has made far more progress in FHIR adoption than expected.
- Next steps include the launch of pilot projects with selected healthcare stakeholders and expanded adoption of FHIR across the healthcare ecosystem.
- Expected changes include significant cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a more robust digital health ecosystem in the next three years.
