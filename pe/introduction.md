**Peru** has shown an interest in adopting FHIR, with several legislative documents, such as the Digital Government Law (DL. No. 1412) and the Digital Government Secretary Resolution (No. 002-2019-PCM/SEGDI), mentioning FHIR as a mandated standard. However, the implementation of these standards is still in the early stages, and there are no fines or compliance deadlines established yet. The Peruvian government, through the Ministry of Health (MINSA) and the Administrative Directorate, has expressed commitment to digital health, as evidenced by their participation in the "American Network for the Cooperation on Electronic Health-RACSEL" ([RACSEL](http://www.racsel.org/)).

## National Standards Development

While Peru does not currently have a national FHIR data model, the country has taken steps towards interoperability in health information systems. The Digital Health Agenda Norm highlights the goal for Peru to have an interoperable digital health system by 2030. Furthermore, administrative directives like Nº 266-MINSA/2019/OGTI provide guidance for the implementation of interoperability in healthcare information systems.

## FHIR Implementation

FHIR adoption in Peru is anticipated to grow, with the Ministry of Health advocating for its use in the Directiva Administrativa Nº 266-MINSA/2019/OGTI. Although specific FHIR use cases have not been widely reported, the country looks forward to implementing the National Health Electronic Records system using FHIR.

Challenges such as high investment costs, unclear regulations, and a lack of FHIR knowledge are present. These are areas that will require focus and resources to improve the successful adoption and implementation of FHIR in the healthcare system.

Stakeholders in Peru's FHIR adoption include government entities, academia, and enterprises, all contributing to the progress towards a more integrated and interoperable healthcare system.

It is clear that while there is a mandate and advocacy for FHIR, practical application and development are still ongoing.
