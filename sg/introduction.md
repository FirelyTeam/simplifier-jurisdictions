**In Singapore**, the use of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is gaining momentum in the healthcare sector. FHIR is a standard describing data formats and elements (known as "resources") and an application programming interface (API) for exchanging electronic health records (EHR). The use of FHIR in Singapore is currently at a significant level, with the latest version, R4B, rated at 5 for its usage, indicating widespread adoption. The adoption of FHIR is expected to increase in the coming years, with optimistic projections for its continued growth.

## Rules and Support
- **Health Data Exchange Rules**: Currently, there are no specific regulations mandating the use of standards like FHIR in electronic health data exchange in Singapore.
- **FHIR Requirements**: There's an ongoing effort led by Synapxe Pte Ltd, a HealthTech agency under the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH), to mandate the use of HL7 FHIR at the national level.
- **Deadlines and Fines**: There are no deadlines or fines imposed for non-compliance since regulations are not yet in place.
- **Available Funding**: No government funds are specifically allocated to stimulate the adoption of FHIR.

## National Setup
- **Standards Organization**: A division within the Singapore MOH is responsible for health data standards, though it hasn't officially included data exchange standards like HL7 FHIR yet.
- **Implementation Guides**: The base/core FHIR implementation guide is widely used, with guides in the process of being published online.
- **Terminology Services**: There are no national FHIR terminology servers available, nor plans to establish one currently.

## Active Use Cases
- **Local Implementations**: FHIR is utilized in various specific use cases such as Prescriptions/Pharmacy, Referrals/Continuity of care, Terminology, Diagnostic Orders/Reports, Immunizations, and Patient Access.
- **Key Projects**: The Healthier SG national program is a notable example of FHIR in action, demonstrating its potential to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes.

## Who's Using FHIR
- **Active Organizations**: Care providers, EHR system vendors, and app developers are among the primary users of FHIR in Singapore.
- **Main Reasons for Adoption**: The adoption is driven by the need to improve care workflows, innovate, and lower IT implementation costs.
- **Usage**: FHIR is mainly used through REST APIs, showcasing its flexibility and ease of integration into existing systems.

## Success Stories and Challenges
- **Benefits**: The adoption of FHIR has led to lowered costs and improved access to information. The Healthier SG program is highlighted as a successful use case.
- **Difficulties**: A significant challenge is overcoming the initial perception that HL7 FHIR is complex and hard to implement.
- **Future Plans**: There are plans to build an HL7 FHIR-based terminology server for internal use by a national IT system.

## Future Plans
- **Progress**: Singapore has made far more progress than expected in the adoption of FHIR, with expanded use across the healthcare ecosystem.
- **Next Steps**: Efforts are underway to mandate the use of HL7 FHIR at the national level and include it as an official responsibility within the MOH.
- **Expected Changes**: In the next three years, significant benefits from FHIR adoption are anticipated, including cost savings, enhanced care coordination, and a robust digital health ecosystem.
