*This overview is based on the insights gathered from the DevDays 2024 State of FHIR survey.*

### Regulation

As of now, Sweden does not have a specific regulation mandating the use of standards in electronic health data exchange, including FHIR. However, efforts are underway to accelerate the adoption of such standards on a national level.

### Adoption

FHIR is emerging as a key player in Sweden’s healthcare data exchange, with considerable momentum towards wider adoption. The FHIR R4 version is already being extensively used, signaling a positive trend in its integration. Current projections show a strong increase in FHIR adoption in the coming years, indicating growing confidence and commitment within the industry.

### Authoritative Bodies

Several authoritative bodies are driving the development and implementation of FHIR standards in Sweden. Key organizations include [HL7 Sweden](https://hl7.se) and the Swedish Standards Institute (SIS). These bodies are essential in guiding the national strategy for electronic health data exchange standards.

### Relevant Institutes

The adoption and implementation of FHIR within Sweden see significant inputs from diverse sectors. Major adopters include healthcare providers, payers, insurance companies, EHR vendors, and app developers. Their collective efforts are pushing forward the national agenda for improved and standardized healthcare data exchange.

### National Standards Development

Sweden is actively working on creating a national FHIR data model. The model is currently under development, supported by several specific FHIR standards for various use cases. To know more about this ongoing effort, you can visit the [FHIR Basprofiler](https://hl7.se/valkommen-till-arbetsgrupp-fhir-basprofiler/) hosted by HL7 Sweden. The government aims to expedite these standardization processes by providing necessary resources.

### Terminology Usage

Sweden’s approach to FHIR implementation includes the development of domain-specific profiles via HL7 Sweden, which aligns with international FHIR frameworks while addressing local healthcare needs. This nuanced attention ensures that the terminology used within the data models is both relevant and effective.

### Infrastructure

Sweden is investing in regional and national infrastructures to facilitate seamless integration of FHIR standards by software companies. Requirements for these companies to plug into the national healthcare IT ecosystem are continually being defined to ensure compatibility and enhance data exchange efficiency.

### Conclusion

The state of FHIR in Sweden is marked by optimistic progression and strategic development. While regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, the commitment from authoritative bodies and the government’s support are clear indicators of a promising future for standardized healthcare data exchange in the country.
