*This summary presents the current state of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) in Sweden based on the [HL7 FHIR DevDays](https://devdays.com) 2024 State of FHIR survey results provided by Robert Bjerv√•s of HL7 Sweden.*

# General Introduction

As of now, FHIR is being used for a few health data exchange use cases in Sweden. Among the FHIR versions in use, R4 is most widespread, while R5 is starting to gain traction. The future foresees a strong increase in the adoption rate of FHIR in response to the inevitable digital transformation wave in the healthcare sector.

# Regulation

Although there aren't any regulations currently prescribing the use of FHIR for health data exchange in Sweden, there are initiatives in progress that aim to expedite the use of such standards on a national level. Despite the absence of a specific funding programme to stimulate the adoption of FHIR, these efforts reflect a positive direction for a regulated and standardized e-health scenario.

# National Standards Development

On the standards development front, Sweden has national organizations such as [HL7 Sweden](https://hl7.se) and the Swedish Standards Institute working on these issues. A national FHIR data model is being formulated, which reflects the government's ambition to promote resources for the acceleration of national standards development. Certain FHIR standards for more specific use cases are also being developed, some of which derive from this national FHIR data model. This underscores the government's commitment to a standardised, interoperable health data exchange environment.

# FHIR Implementation 

Mainly, care providers and EHR vendors are taking the lead in FHIR adoption in Sweden. Regulation, grants, and the improvement of care are the key driving factors for this process. The FHIR Rest API is known to be commonly used amongst those who are incorporating FHIR into their digital health infrastructures. However, patient advocacy for the availability of healthcare data is still in its nascent stage. The 'Swedish National Medication List' stands as a successful FHIR use case that lowered costs and improved healthcare outcomes, demonstrating the potential for other successful implementations. Despite the ongoing challenges like high investment costs, unclear benefits, regulations, and lack of FHIR knowledge, efforts such as those made by HL7 Sweden to create domain-specific profiles signify a positive trajectory in overcoming these hurdles.

*Although the journey towards extensive FHIR adoption in Sweden has just initiated, the country is moving forward with promising initiatives. It encapsulates the idea of a future where regulated, standardised, and interoperable health data exchanges are the mainstream - paving the way for improved healthcare outcomes, efficiency, and innovation.*
