**In Costa Rica**, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is in the early stages of adoption for healthcare data exchange. The country is utilizing the FHIR standard to improve the sharing of health information across systems. Currently, there's a focus on developing a base/core FHIR implementation guide, showing a commitment to adopting this international standard. Expectations are set for a significant increase in the adoption rate of FHIR in the coming years.
